1. Your program randomly select a number btw 1 -1000.
Then take an input from the user to guess the number and give them clues.
Print Higher if the number guessed is higher or Lower
Give the user 20 chances to guess the number.

2. My keyboard is stuck and sometimes repeats the last word. Write a function to only remove the subsequent repeated word from a string. For Example.

For a string "Hey this is is a fun fun assignment is it not not "

Output should be "Hey this is a fun assigment is it not "

[Note: It should keep the is later in the sentence]

score = {"a": 1 , "b": 3 , "c": 3 , "d": 2 ,
         "e": 1 , "f": 4 , "g": 2 , "h": 4 ,
         "i": 1 , "j": 8 , "k": 5 , "l": 1 ,
