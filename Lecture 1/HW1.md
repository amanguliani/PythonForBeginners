# Knowledge Test

## 1 Describe one difference between compliers and interpreters.

## 2 Name one high level language which uses compliers and one that uses interpreters.

## 3 Write an algorithm for finding a number from a file which has sorted numbers. (Assume you have functions to read the file line by line and one number is written per line)

## 4 Write a function that takes name of the person running the program and prints "Hey there <Name> !" [Hint: Try looking up input()= and see what it does]

## 5 Write a function which prints cubes of all values from 1 to 20

## 6 Write the output of the expression 2.0 * 5 / 1 - 4 

## 7 Execute the following line and answer the questions
n = input("Please a select a number between 1 and 5")

### a. Whats the data type of n ?
### b. Whats happens when you do n + 5
### c. Change the line to say n = exec(input("Please a select a number between 1 and 5")), now whats the data type of n ?


# Coding Porblem

## 1. Write a program to convert temperature that user enters in Celius to Farenhite (No i dont expect you to know the formulae from the top of your head, F = 9/5 C + 32)

## 2. Write a program for a calculator which can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, divition and exponential. Take the numbers and the operatation to be performed from the user.
