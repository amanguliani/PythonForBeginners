1. True or False - List can only contain elements of one data type, for example, only strings or only numbers.

2. For the list1 = ["Mike", "", "Emma", "Kelly", "", "Brad"] remove spaces from the list 

3. Given two lists
list1 = ["M", "na", "i", "Ke"] 
list2 = ["y", "me", "s", "lly"]

Concatenate the lists so the output is ['My', 'name', 'is', 'Kelly']

4. Given a Python dictionary, Change Dillon's salary to 8500
sampleDict = {
     'emp1': {'name': 'Bob', 'salary': 7500},
     'emp2': {'name': 'Alice', 'salary': 8000},
     'emp3': {'name': 'Dillon', 'salary': 6500}
}

5. Which of the following is true for sets in python (chose all that applies)
a. The elements is the set not be duplicate
b. You can access the elemnts in a set using its index.
c. The order of elements in set are unordered. 
d. You cannot add elemnts to the set once created.

# Small coding projects
1. Decode the code : You are given this dict word_frequency = {"a": 3, "c": 4, "e": 2, "k":1, "o": 5}
create the code word from it. Output should be aaacccceekooooo

2. Write a function which takes a dollar amount and breaks it down into how many quaters (25 cents), dimes (10 cents), nickels (5 cents) and pennies (1 cent) would it contain.

3. Given a sentence containing n words. Remove all duplicates words keeping the order of the rest of the words the same.
